## Exercise I

a) O(n)


b) O(n log(n))


c) O(n)

## Exercise II

O(log n)

I would employ a binary search to design the solution.
STEPS
1-set target in params
2-set ceiling 
3-set floor
3- have a while loop that halves the sorted list checking whether the target
is less than or greater than the each half.
4- If the target not found reset the middle index(the index between the two halves) and half it until the target is found
